绿街是小城上最繁华的街道。

我走上绿街，远远地看到地上有一片毯子在挪动。走近后，我才注意到瘦窄的她。她上半身黑色的夹克衫，已有一半隐匿进背景。

我不敢回头去看她的正脸。这个动作有太多可能的解读：我打量她、我同情她、我鄙视她、我嘲笑她。在她和周围人之间，除去有房子住和没有房子住之外，另有一层社会性的围栏把人群隔离开来。

我记得上周在同样的位置，有个白人青年就靠坐在她身边，同她聊天。我也很想听她的故事，可我是文化上的外来者，对这个文明有好奇，也有恐惧。

但它的图腾之一声名远扬。我想告诉她，其实那毯子有点像超人的披风。

我在每个人身上看到披风。

Green Street is the most prosperous street in this small city.

As I walked onto Green Street, I saw from afar a blanket moving on the ground. Only when I got closer did I notice her slender, frail figure. The black jacket on her upper body had already half-blended into the background.

I didn't dare turn back to look at her face. That action could be interpreted in too many ways: I'm sizing her up, I pity her, I despise her, I mock her. Between her and the people around her, beyond the simple divide of having shelter or not, there exists another layer of social fence separating the crowds.

I remember last week, at the same spot, a young white man sat right beside her, chatting with her. I too wanted to hear her story, but I'm a cultural outsider to this civilization—with curiosity, yes, but also with fear.

Yet one of its totems is world-renowned. I wanted to tell her that the blanket is actually a bit like Superman's cape.

I see capes on everyone.
