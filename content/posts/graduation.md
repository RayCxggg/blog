我在六教的四楼找了间教室坐下，等待夕阳混进雨后的天空，摸两张校园美景。

第一次喝自助机里的咖啡，11块钱，酸酸甜甜苦苦的，别有一份风味。一周后就要毕业离校，一段七年的生命历程即将迎来终点，难免要让优柔寡断的25岁年轻人感慨一番。

我记得大一的微积分和线性代数课总是安排在六教。每周一和周三早晨八点，近两百人就挤进负一层的阶梯教室，在弥漫着汗味、早餐味和困意的空气里，完成五节课的学习。课堂上很少人说话，基本是老师在不停地翻课件，把一行行公式塞给我们。下课之后，大家在停车场挤，在学堂路挤，在食堂挤，一路挤回宿舍，或者赶去下一间教室。

这几乎是我本科时代的缩影。我在数学物理化学编程课里疲于奔命，电路入门课难度更犹如登天，让我的大部分学术兴趣在入门时就被繁重的课程消耗殆尽。

我怀念这里吗？当然。但我怀念的大概不是这里的生活，而是这里的自己。

I found an empty classroom on the fourth floor of Building Six. Sat down. Waited for the sunset to bleed into the rain-washed sky, hoping to catch a few good shots of campus.

My first time trying the vending machine coffee. Eleven yuan. Sweet and sour and bitter all at once—oddly satisfying. In a week I'll graduate and leave. Seven years of life coming to an end. Hard not to feel something, at twenty-five, still indecisive as ever.

I remember freshman year calculus and linear algebra were always in Building Six. Every Monday and Wednesday at 8 AM, nearly two hundred of us crammed into the basement lecture hall. The air thick with sweat, breakfast, and exhaustion. Five straight periods. Hardly anyone spoke. Just the professor flipping through slides, feeding us formula after formula. After class, we'd push through the bike lot, push down Xuetang Road, push through the dining hall, all the way back to the dorms—or off to the next classroom.

That was basically my undergrad in a nutshell. Drowning in math, physics, chemistry, coding. The intro circuits course felt impossible. Most of my academic curiosity got ground down before it ever had a chance to grow.

Do I miss this place? Of course. But what I miss isn't the life here—it's who I was here.
